========================================  Part 1  ========================================  

1. we will need to keep track of each process' break and heap start address
    - are these not the same thing?
    - no they're not, the heap start address is the original spot, the break is the top of
     the heap

2. sbrk takes a VIRTUAAL ADDRESS not a physical one
    - you might ask how brk works if you get an address in the middle of a page:
    - well, when you're accessing memory, you'll first have to check if the 
      unaligned value needs an additional page
    - essentially, we are still working with units of pages!

3. we only care about the brk function -- returns 0 on success, -1 on error

4. brk outline:
    a. align the input address --> should always go to smallest page boundary >= addr
    b. allocate pages if needed
    c. change breakpoint to input address

5. we need to error check the brk call, here are some that i think might pop up
    a. target below heap start address
    b. target inside already used memory, ie mmapped region or stack
        i. extra note, i think mmap will default to a place away from both



========================================  Part 2  ========================================  

1. we're going to be copying large parts of this from the canvas files

2. first thing we're going to make is the header
    - the header is 16 bytes, we're also going to follow the four 16 byte word strategy
    - we may be able to get away with less

3. we have also implemented the footer

4. as a side note, you have to remember to always malloc a minimum of 4 words (might be 3)

5. we'll extend by 1/2 a page each time there's no space
